1. Task: Movie Recommendation System

2. Proposed Solution: 

This project builds a movie recommendation engine that blends data from multiple sources for personalized suggestions. It analyzes user inputs using NLP to find thematic links between films, offering an interactive multimedia experience for refining movie preferences. Techniques such as multithreading, batched embedding calculations and multi-level cache ensure performance and responsiveness of app.

2.1 Input/Output Architecture
2.1.1 System Inputs
        - Three user-selected reference movies that form the basis for recommendations

2.1.2 System Outputs
        - Recommendation Set: A curated list of five films selected based on similarity metrics and quality factors
        - Knowledge Graph: Interactive visualization showing connections between movies via common cast, crew, genres, and thematic elements
        - Preference Profile: Real-time bar graph representing user genre preferences derived from input selections
        - Interactive Movie Pool: Expandable collection of similar and trending films that users can evaluate to dynamically adjust their preference profile

2.2 Technical Implementation
2.2.1 Data Sources and Integration
        The system retrieves and merges data from two primary sources:
            - TMDB API for core movie metadata, ratings, and popularity metrics
            - Wikidata SPARQL queries for richer thematic information and additional connections

        This dual-source approach enables more comprehensive recommendation capabilities than relying on a single dataset would provide.

2.2.2 Recommendation Algorithm
        The recommendation process follows these technical steps:
            - Reference movie data is collected in parallel through batched API calls
            - A candidate pool is assembled from films sharing actors, directors, writers, genres, or themes with reference movies
            - Recent trending films are dynamically incorporated to enhance freshness
            - Text embeddings are generated using the paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2 model (384-dimensional vectors)
            - Cosine similarity measurements identify thematic connections between movies
            - Films are ranked according to a goodness score:
               +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
               | goodness_score = 0.3*popularity + 0.7*(vote_average * log10(vote_count)) |
               +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
            - The top 5 highest-scoring candidates are returned as recommendations

2.2.3 Performance Optimization
        Several critical optimizations ensure responsive system performance:
            - Multi-level Caching Architecture:
                L1: Streamlit's cache_data decorators for UI component memoization
                L2: diskcache library implementation for persistent storage of API responses and computation results

            - Concurrent Processing: ThreadPoolExecutor implementation for parallel API requests

            - Batched embedding calculations to reduce model initialization overhead

            - Intelligent Data Fetching: Prioritized loading of critical data (basic movie metadata to show recommendation) before supplementary information (like cast, plot, keywords to generate similarity graph) to increase responsiveness

2.2.4 Visualization Components
        The knowledge graph is implemented using Cytoscape.js with custom styling and layouts to visualize:
            - Movie-to-movie connections
            - Cast and crew relationships
            - Thematic associations

        User preference profiles are dynamically calculated based on initial selections and subsequent interactions, providing real-time feedback on genre affinities.

2.2.5 Conclusion
        This movie recommendation system employs advanced data processing techniques and natural language understanding to identify multi-dimensional connections between films. The implementation balances computational efficiency with recommendation quality by leveraging caching, multithreading, and intelligent prioritization of computation-intensive operations.
